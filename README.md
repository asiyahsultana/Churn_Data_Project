# Churn_Data_Project
Our goal with this project was to identify as solution to help Telco reduce issue of customer churn and improve their customer retention. We used the IBM Telco Churn Dataset from Kaggle. The code file labeled 'preprocessing, visualization, and clustering' shows our steps of pre-processing and cleaning through the ETL methods, using visualization to find customerTo achieve our goal, and using K-means clustering. The filed labeled RegressionAnalysis shows the process of regression analysis method used. We also added the initial and cleaned datasets.

For the preprocessing visualization and clustering code:

Ensure all necessary packages are imported
Open csv file containing dataset
Using seaborn, visualizations preformed
Clean and transform dataset by dropping or converting labels as fit
Load to new csv file, open
Perform clustering by choosing amount of clusters

For the Regression Analysis code:
