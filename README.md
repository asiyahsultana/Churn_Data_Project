# Churn_Data_Project
This project is for the class Intro to Human Centered Data Science. Our goal with this project was to identify as solution to help Telco reduce issue of customer churn and improve their customer retention. We used the IBM Telco Churn Dataset from Kaggle. The code file labeled 'preprocessing, visualization, and clustering' shows our steps of pre-processing and cleaning through the ETL methods, using visualization to find customerTo achieve our goal, and using K-means clustering. The filed labeled RegressionAnalysis shows the process of regression analysis method used. We also added the initial dataset (Telco_customer_churn.xlsx) and cleaned dataset (clean).

For the preprocessing visualization and clustering code:
Ensure all necessary packages are imported
Open csv file containing dataset
Using seaborn, visualizations preformed
Clean and transform dataset by dropping or converting labels as fit
Load to new csv file, open
Perform clustering by choosing amount of clusters

For the Regression Analysis code:
Open the file
Make sure all the needed packages (statsmodel, numpy, pandas) are imported
Open CSV file that contains the dataset
After specifying X and Y as the variables to be examined, run the code; it performs a regression analysis to find a relationship between two of the variables
Import matplotlib package
Run section of the code using matplotlib to create visualization of linear regression
